simple challenge for evaluation

This is a .Net 4.6.1 Asp.Net WebForm application. I tried to create it in React Native, but I haven't figured out how to import data and make responsive tables yet. So I went with what i could use to finish in a few hours.

I built this with an older laptop and the Free version of VS 2017, so developing it was very slow. I could have done more, but it is fairly fast, responsive and just has a couple very minor contract accessibility issues.

To run for basic evaluation, just open the .sln file in Visual Studio 2017 and hit the debug button. It should launch your default browser to localhost and load the app. It's just one page with a table.

I hope you like it.
