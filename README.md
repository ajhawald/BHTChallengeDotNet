# BHTChallengeDotNet
simple challenge for evaluation

This is a .Net 4.6.1 Asp.Net WebForm application. 

CONFIGURATION - AFTER YOUV'VE CLONED, YOU MUST SET THE "jsonFilePath" APPSETTING IN THE WEB.CONFIG FILE. THIS SHOULD BE THE FULL PATH TO THE SEED.JSON FILE IN THE ROOT OF THE APP. THE PATH SHOULD LOOK LIKE 'C:\Users\Andy\Documents\BHTChallenge\BHTChallenge\seed_data.json'. 

To run for basic evaluation, just open the .sln file in Visual Studio 2017 and hit the debug button. It should launch your default browser to localhost and load the app. It's just one page with a table.
